# 🌿 CO₂ Emission Prediction Using Simple Linear Regression

This project uses the official **Fuel Consumption Ratings Dataset (Canada)** to build a simple linear regression model that predicts **CO₂ emissions (g/km)** based on **engine size (L)**.

## 📂 Files Included

- `Simple_linear_regression.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with data cleaning, visualization, modeling, and evaluation

## 📊 Dataset Features

The dataset includes vehicle specifications such as:
- Engine Size (L)
- Number of Cylinders
- Transmission Type
- Fuel Type
- Fuel Consumption (City/Highway/Combined)
- CO₂ Emissions (g/km) ← **Target variable**

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## 🎯 Objectives

- Explore the real-world fuel efficiency dataset
- Visualize the relationship between engine size and CO₂ emissions
- Build and evaluate a **Simple Linear Regression** model
- Plot the regression line and evaluate with R² and MSE
